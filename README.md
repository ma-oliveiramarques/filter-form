# 💻 Filter Form
![preview of the project](./.github/filter_form_preview.png 'Filter form page')
The purpose of this project is to build an interface that can filter the information that the user wants to see by text input.
The information is organized by cards. For testing purposes, I only created four cards.
I used a form to receive the input to filter and the filter was applied directly to the titles of each card. This filter was applied using JS DOM manipulation.
